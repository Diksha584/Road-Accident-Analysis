# 🚦Road-Accident-Analysis
Road Accident Analysis using Power BI, SQL and Excel

## 📊 Overview
This project presents an interactive **Road Accident Analysis Dashboard** developed to analyze accident casualties across different dimensions such as vehicle type, road type, road surface, light condition, location, and yearly trends.  
The dashboard helps in identifying patterns, high-risk areas, and major contributing factors to road accidents.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze total casualties and their severity (Fatal, Serious, Slight)
- Compare **Current Year (CY)** vs **Previous Year (PY)** casualty trends
- Identify accident distribution by:
  - Vehicle type
  - Road type
  - Road surface condition
  - Light condition
  - Urban vs Rural areas
- Support data-driven decisions for road safety improvement

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- **Total Casualties:** 417,883  
- Majority of casualties are **Slight injuries (~84%)**
- **Cars** contribute to the highest number of casualties
- **Single carriageway roads** report the maximum accidents
- Most accidents occur on **dry road surfaces**
- **Urban areas** have higher casualties compared to rural
- Daylight conditions show more reported accidents than dark conditions

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** – Dashboard creation & visualization  
- **MS Excel** – Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **DAX** – Measures and calculated fields  
- **Data Visualization Techniques** – KPIs, charts, slicers

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Process
- Removed duplicate and null records
- Standardized categorical fields (road type, vehicle type, light condition)
- Created calculated measures for:
  - Total casualties
  - Severity percentages
  - Yearly and monthly trends
- Validated data consistency across years

---

## 🧱 Dashboard Structure
- **KPI Section:** Total, Fatal, Serious & Slight casualties  
- **Trend Analysis:** CY vs PY monthly casualties  
- **Distribution Analysis:**
  - Vehicle Type
  - Road Type
  - Road Surface
  - Light Condition
  - Location (Urban/Rural)
- **Filter Panel:** Year and area-based slicers for dynamic analysis

## 📚 Key Learnings
- Improved understanding of accident severity analysis
- Hands-on experience with Power BI DAX calculations
- Learned how to design an insight-driven dashboard
- Enhanced data storytelling and visualization skills

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add accident cause analysis
- Include state/city-wise breakdown
- Integrate real-time or live datasets
- Predictive analysis using historical data
